# Screenshots

This page is generated automatically. To regenerate it:

**Prerequisites (once per machine)**

- Install the browser: run **`npx playwright install chromium`** from the project root.
- For admin screenshots, set env vars **`SCREENSHOT_LOGIN_EMAIL`** and **`SCREENSHOT_LOGIN_PASSWORD`** (e.g. in `.env` or on the command line). Use the seeded admin: **`admin@kiosk.local`** / **`admin123`**.

**Steps each time**

1. Start the app (e.g. **`composer run dev`** or **`make up`**). Leave it running.
2. In another terminal, from the **project root**, run: **`npm run screenshots`** (or **`make screenshots`** or **`composer run screenshots`**).
3. This script overwrites the images in `docs/screenshots/` and this file.
